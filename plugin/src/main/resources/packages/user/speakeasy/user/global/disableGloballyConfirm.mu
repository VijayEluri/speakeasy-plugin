    This will disable the '{{pluginKey}}' extension globally for all Speakeasy users.  This means:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>It will immediately be disabled for all users</li>
    <li>Speakeasy users will be able to enable it individually</li>
    <li>To disable it for all users, without allowing them to enable it again, disable the plugin in the Plugin Manager</li>
</ul>
